<p>This analysis focuses on 36 nutrients over a thousand of common food items available in any Canadian grocery store. The unhealthiest nutrients, unsaturated fats, sugar, and sodium can be found in processed food and fat meats and poultry. The healthy nutrients like proteins, minerals can be found in lean meat and fish, low sugar and low fat dairy products and beans. Vitamins can be sought in eggs.
